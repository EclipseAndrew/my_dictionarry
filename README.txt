Name: "My dictionarry" and you can try to use it [here](https://eclipseandrew.github.io/my_dictionarry/)

This mini project I begined because of I had a lot of dictionaries and I wanted to do some structural my that all.

Also I had a good practice in building of site and additional logic by using JS. 

At the beginning this project seems is not so hard. But I planning to increase more abilities for (users) ability to learn and remember more words.
